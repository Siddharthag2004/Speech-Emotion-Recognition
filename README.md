# Speech Emotion Recognition
## Introduction
**Speech emotion recognition (SER) is the field of technology focused on identifying the emotional state of a speaker from their voice. This goes beyond the words spoken and analyzes how they are spoken.
**The idea behind creating this project was to build a machine-learning model that could detect emotions from the speech we have with each other all the time. Nowadays personalization is something that is needed in all the things we experience every day.
